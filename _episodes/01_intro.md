## Welcome

### Introduction to Coding For Reproducible Research

This workshop is offered as part of the [Coding For Reproducible Research Intiative](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/workshop-homepage/). 
Our ambition is to offer a recurring annual series of workshops open to all staff and students, with opportunities for novices through to more experienced users, to expand their skillsets and position them to confidently perform the informatics research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. Our network included the Research Software Engineering Team and researchers from across the Univeristy who are enthusatastic about sharing their skills. A key objective is that the framework we put in place ensures that the workshops delivered are fit for purpose, of a consistent high standard, that delivery is sustainable in the longer term, minimises the workload burden on those who facilitate them and can adapt and expand as new training needs are identified. The programme and workshops are under constant evolution and we are grateful for your feedback which is a core component of this process. We also need to maintain accurate records of how many participants we have reached, so ask you to mark you attendence on the collaborative document.

Championed by and in partnership with

* Research Software Engineering group
* Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IDSAI)
* Researcher Development (Doctoral College and ECRs)
* Reproducibility Network Institutional Leadership team
* Exeter Health Analytics Research Network 

### Workshop format

Today's workshop is led by XX and supported by XX. We are all here because we are passionate about sharing our knowledge and supporting the development of our colleagues. For most of us, this is not a requirement of our current position and we are doing this at the margins of our time.

This workshop is a mixture of statistical theory (don't panic), live demonstrations of R code and exercises for you to complete. We are delivering in a hybrid format, please be aware of this. Online participants we find that engagement is higher if you are willing to turn your cameras on. There will be a dedicated helper for online participants please, either raise your hand or type any questions into the chat. 

Our aim is to be responsive to the needs of the group, both in person and virtual. Therefore, think of the schedule as a guide rather than a strict timetable. We welcome questions and queries as we go along, there are helpers in the room so raise your hand if you need assistance. There is also a dedicated helper for the virtual participants so please raise your virtual hand to attract their attention or post in the chat. 

We would like to highlight that we have a [code of conduct](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/intro-regression-with-r/code.html) and by attending this workshop you are agreeing to abide by it. 

Let's get started.
