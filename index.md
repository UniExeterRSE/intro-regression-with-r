## Overview

Regression analysis is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between multiple variables. It is a very flexible tool that can handle a range of different data types (continuous, binary or categorical) and address both complex and simple research questions. In this hands on workshop you will learn how to fit a range of regression models with R, how to interpret the output and the link between regression and other common statistical tools.

## Course objectives

This course will covering the following:

* Understand the types of questions regression can be used to answer.
* Be able to fit a linear regression model with multiple predictor variables. 
* Be able to fit logistic regression model with multiple predictor variables. 
* Be able to extract and summarise the results from a range of regression models.
* Be able to design a regression model appropriate for addressing their specific research question.


## Pre-requisite knowledge

Learners are expected to already be familiar with the basics of R, such as how to load a dataset from a local file and manipulate variables. 

## Workshop format

This a hybrid workshop run over 1 sessions. The [schedule can be found here](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/intro-regression-with-r/schedule.html).
